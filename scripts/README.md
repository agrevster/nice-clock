# Nice Clock - Scripts

> Used to pull a team's logo from ESPN.com for use as a clock image.

*Note: Some logos don't work well as they are being downsized and may require manual intervention.*

### Usage:
1. Install decencies: `pip install pillow requests`
2. Find team ID and type from website. `https://www.espn.com/`**`nfl`**`/team/_/name/`**`buf`**`/buffalo-bills`
3. Run the script and enter this info.
4. Congrats! You now have a `PPM` logo for your desired team.
